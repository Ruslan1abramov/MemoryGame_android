Memory Game
Created by ruslan abramov
In this game there is one log in screen, one difficulty selection screen and one game screen.
The game screen uses 3 switches between 2 boards Iâ€™ve made one for each difficulty(2*2 , 4*4 , 5*5)
Each time you start a game the board picks random cards from 12 available cards and builds the board randomly
In the 5*5 board there is one card that is not responsive it has a different  picture from the rest,
the reason for that is that we need to pick pairs and there are only 12 pairs in 25.
